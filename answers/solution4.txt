Problem 4 - REST API
--------------------
Choose a web framework (e.g. Flask, Django REST Framework). Create a REST API with the following GET endpoints:

/api/weather
/api/weather/stats

Both endpoints should return a JSON-formatted response with a representation of the ingested/calculated data in your database. Allow clients to filter the response by date and station ID (where present) using the query string. Data should be paginated.

Include a Swagger/OpenAPI endpoint that provides automatic documentation of your API.

Your answer should include all files necessary to run your API locally, along with any unit tests.

===================================================ANSWER==============================================================
here, we need to create REST API, so I have created flask APP 

I have also added swagger document for the API that have been created 

API's are 
/swagger
/api/weather/
/api/weather/stats/

and Command to start FLASK app is 
GOTO src/flask_api
python app.py
