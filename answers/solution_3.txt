Problem 3 - Data Analysis
-------------------------
For every year, for every weather station, calculate:

* Average maximum temperature (in degrees Celsius)
* Average minimum temperature (in degrees Celsius)
* Total accumulated precipitation (in centimeters)

Ignore missing data when calculating these statistics.

Design a new data model to store the results. Use NULL for statistics that cannot be calculated.

Your answer should include the new model definition as well as the code used to calculate the new values and store them in the database.

===============================================ANSWER======================================================================

Model that is created for storing the data Analysis is 
CREATE TABLE  ANALYTICS_DATA_TABLE
(station VARCHAR2(50),
year VARCHAR2(4),
avg_min_tem NUMBER,
avg_max_tem NUMBER,
total_acc_participation NUMBER
);


I have created SQL query to read data from weather table and generate new table 

command:
python data_analytics.py
